                        Take flight as a winged warrior in the middle of a massive war
                        in Aion, a stunning massively multiplayer online roleplaying 
                        game where abundant solo adventures, intriguing epic group quests,
                        challenging dungeons, and massive Legion raids hone your battle
                        skills as you ascend to new heights.

                        <br>
                        Two playable factions, the Asmodians and the Elyos, inhabit 
                        the two halves of the shattered world of Atreia, battling one
                        another for ultimate control over Atreia.

                        Your adventure begins with you choosing a side - will you join the
                        fight with the Elyos or pledge your allegiance to the Asmodians? Next,
                        choose a class - your choice will define the fundamental abilities and
                        role of your character in Aion, especially in a combat situation.

                        When the god Aion created the world of Atreia, 
                        They created the Drakanâ€”powerful dragon-like 
                        beasts; performing Aion's will on the planet; and 
                        protecting the Tower of Eternity. <br>For a time, 
                        the Drakan obeyed Aion; but over time, they 
                        began to enjoy their power, ignoring their 
                        duties and abusing the humans who inhabited 
                        Atreia.<br> Aion took notice, creating the twelve
                        Empyrean Lords in response. As time went on, 
                        the Lords decided that they had to be more 
                        aggressive in stopping the Balaur. his conflict
                        would come to be known as the Millennium War.
                        As the war progressed, a faction of Lords began
                        to view the war as unwinnable, and Lord Israphel
                        proposed a discussion of peace with the Balaur.

                        However, for reasons unclear, the negotiation failed. 
                        When the Balaur arrived at the Tower of Eternity, a 
                        commotion broke out, killing a Balaurian captain; 
                        the remaining Balaur, enraged, marched upon and 
                        destroyed the Tower, which set off a chain reaction 
                        that threatened to destroy the planet. However, 
                        Israphel and Siel made the ultimate sacrifice and 
                        gave their own lives to protect Atreia. The world 
                        was shattered into two "hemi-shells", with a dark 
                        Abyss lying between them; but it was held together 
                        by the aetheric field created from the Tower Lords' 
                        sacrifice. The planet split in two parts. Inhabitants
                        of the lower part named their world Elyos, and Asmodae
                        has been created on the top part of planet. The inhabitants 
                        of both parts did not suspect of the existence of each other.

                        A group of brave daevas entered the rift and were amazed.
                        the inhabitants of that world were similar to the daevas 
                        of the past. They had sparkling white wing, but they hearts were
                        full of hatred to Asmodaes.
